- One challenge was finding a reliable XPath that targets only the Top 10 vulnerabilities. Some links on the page matched the pattern but were unrelated or duplicates.
I solved this by filtering out entries with empty titles and using a partial match on the href attribute.

- Another challenge was running this in headless mode â€” the page sometimes wouldn't render properly. I resolved this by keeping Firefox in visible mode during testing.

-Also I realized using Githubs Codespace enviroment isnt the best approach as was getting an error accessing
chromium or firefox due to githubs built in limitations. Shifting to VS code made job much easietr.
